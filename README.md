# Business Analysis of Mobile Payments in Kenya

## Description & Background
This project analyzes **mobile money data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)** to explore growth trends, usage patterns, seasonality and cashflow patterns.  
Mobile payments have become a **key driver of financial inclusion** and economic activity in Kenya, transforming how individuals, households and businesses transact.
M-Pesa is the most popular payment method, followed by PayPal, Airtel and other alternative methods. These methods allow users to store money in a digital wallet, transfer funds, pay bills and also access microloans convinienetly using their phones.


The analysis focuses on:
- Registered mobile money accounts  
- Active agents  
- Transaction volumes (Millions)  
- Transaction values (KES Billions)
- Value per transaction 

Data coverage spans from **March 2007** up to **February 2025**.


## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are to:
1. **Track growth trends** over time in accounts, agents and transactions.  
2. **Identify seasonal patterns**, including consistent peaks and troughs in activity.  
3. **Analyze transaction efficiency** by examining the relationship between value and volume.  
4. **Assess the impact of special events** on mobile payments.  
5. **Evaluate agent network expansion** relative to account and transaction growth.  


## Tools Used
- **Excel**  
  - Data cleaning & structuring  
  - Pivot Tables for growth trend, seasonal summaries and cashflow efficiency  
  - Pivot Charts for visual insights  
  - Year-over-Year growth calculations   
  - Dashboard building  

- **Word/Markdown**  
  - Documentation and insights summary  


## Key Insights
- **Long-term growth**: Accounts, agents, and transactions have all expanded, though **transaction values dipped in 2019 and 2022**, hinting at macroeconomic or policy shocks.  
- **Seasonality**: December consistently shows the **highest transaction values** (holiday effect), with secondary peaks in October–November and July–September.  
- **Cash flow efficiency**: Value per transaction has generally risen, indicating greater use of mobile money for **larger payments**. Dips in 2010 and 2019 suggest temporary shifts toward smaller transfers.  
- **Special events**: No clear COVID-19 decline is visible (likely cushioned by fee waivers), but **2016–2017 saw unusual drops**, possibly linked to election-year uncertainty.  
- **Agent network expansion**: Explosive early growth (2008–2009) reflects adoption momentum, while slower growth in later years suggests rising marginal acquisition costs.
